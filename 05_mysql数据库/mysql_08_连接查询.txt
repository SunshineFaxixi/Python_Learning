（１）inner join
--select ... from 表Ａ inner join 表Ｂ
select * from students inner join classes;

--查询有能够对应班级的学生以及班级信息
select * from students inner join classes on students.cls_id=classes.id;

--按照要求显示姓名、班级
select students.*, classes.name from students inner join classes on students.cls_id=classes.id;
select students.name, classes.name from students inner join classes on students.cls_id=classes.id;
select s.name, c.name from students as s inner join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id; 

--查询有能够对应班级的学生及班级信息，显示学生的所有信息，只显示班级名称
select s.*, c.name from students as s inner join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id;

--在以上查询中，将班级姓名显示在第１列
select c.name, s.* from students as s inner join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id;

--查询有能够对应班级的学生以及班级信息，按照班级进行排序
select c.name, s.* from students as s inner join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id order by c.name;
select c.name, s.* from students as s inner join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id order by c.name, s.id asc;

（２）left join
--查询每位学生对应的信息
select * from students as s left join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id;

--查询没有对应班级信息的学生
select * from students as s left join classes as c on s.cls_id=c.id having c.name is null;

（３）right join
--将数据表名字互换位置，用left join完成
